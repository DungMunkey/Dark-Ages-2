"The Tsaido Birthright by Natrim of Tristen."
"The Tsaido nobles followed a custom that the firstborn daughter of the queen shall inherit the throne, while the later daughters become advisors. Although not known to be excessively violent among the ruling class, some conflicts were found among the nobility."
"The best example is the sixthborn daughter of Queen Wolidrin, Carsina. Wolidrin had been a particularly fertile monarch, but unfortunately only her sixth had the ambition to rule."
"Carsina was the most intelligent daughter who would only play a figurehead in the family because of her birthplace. However, she was not content with her position, and scoured Engel for the most potent poisons."
"Late one night she crept into her sisters' bedrooms, and pricked them each with a pin tainted with syrif poison. The poison was so deadly, no ward could have PROTECTED them. Their invisible wounds became severely INFECTED, and they became ill beyond healing."
"Normally the poision is given in large amounts to kill within minutes, but the cause would have been obvious. With so slow a dose, Carsina watched her sisters die over the next week, slowly bleeding out of their eyes, nose, and ears."
"The Gai'un could offer no explanation other than a mysterious plague. When Wolidrin died thirty-seven years later, Carsina took the throne, the eldest daughter, and sixthborn of the queen."

Most golems are too large, slow, and clumsy for practical use, but perhaps I can refine the techniques to create a more useful servant. It would be nice to have someone serve tea ... <the passage continues with musings>"
"25 Juli 119, I had nearly given up hope, but I made an astonishing discovery while exploring the caves below the cellar. I had ventured to the water for a drink and was watching the cave fish. Like my worthless lumps of rock and metal, they just sat there, then I cast a spell on them ..."
"... the incantations to manipulate flesh are not all that different from those that manipulate mineral. With care I can alter structures. This is an amazing feat and I must retreat to my studies to learn more."
"<@ flips ahead several entries> 2 Februar 120, The fish, if I can still call them that, are developing marvelously. Already, their appendages are developing joints. I'll give them so many arms, they'll be quite useful. Soon, they'll be able to survive outside the water and I can develop their ability to walk and manipulate objects. They are still blind; I'll need to give them sight soon, if I am to expect them to be of any use."
"<flipping further> 7 Mai 122, It has been nearly 5 years since I started my project and I am still amazed at how far from my goals I have wandered. Instead, I have ventured onto something greater. Instead of golems, I now have my own servant creatures! They are magnificent! They are docile and obedient. They learn a little slowly, but can be taught and are well mannered. They've developed quite a taste for meat. Best of all, they are virile, and can be bred ..."
"... They are still blind; the eyes are such difficult things to work with. Perhaps developing this sense will increase their usefulness. I shall begin work soon."
"19 November 122, I have lost contol of the servants. I gave them sight, but made a mistake. I've altered their minds and they've become vicious. They've escaped into the caves and I'll have to be careful in my wanderings down there."
"<the passages become increasingly frantic> 16 Januar 123, They've made an attack on my house! They crept up the cellar in a group of about 30! I cannot believe how fast they've multiplied. I was able to thwart them with a few bright flashes, but they appear to have become much more intelligent than before. I don't think that trick will scare them away next time and I've requested help from the council."
"13 Marz 123, The attacks have become so frequent that I've warded off my cellar door. I think it may hold them. All the magic manipulation has given them the ability to control electrical energy. Yesterday, the five mages from the council arrived by an earlier request I made. They ventured into the caves to see for themselves. I gave them a runestone so that they may return once they've eliminated the rogue servants. I hope they return soon."
"28 Marz 123, The mages have not returned and the council has sent many angry letters demanding information about their members. I fear they may be lost or dead, but dare not report such to the council without proof. I fear they may imprison me for my errors if I cannot fix this disaster. Tomorrow, I'll venture into the caves. <There are no more entries>"

"The Elven Burial Grounds, by Sister Gespenst"
"Unlike humans, elven spirits remain partially attached to the realm of the living. Thousands of years ago the elves of Tristen built their ancestral spirits a maze of underground crypts within which they may 'live' and provide their wisdom to elven descendants."
"Each year elves would travel from all realms of Engel to seek knowledge. But knowledge was never given without merit. Each pilgrim needed to pass a series of tests, before they were granted access of the Halls of the Ancients."
"Usually, the first test was one of respect for the deceased. It may involve a prayer or offering, or some form of cleaning or repair to the crypt. If the individual was respectful, access to the true test was granted."
"The true test was a puzzle, often related to nature. Historical texts have indicated it may have changed several times over the centuries. Earth, Fire, and Water were always involved, as well as holy symbols."
"For instance, one might have carried a rock to the holy symbol for Earth, but pouring water on the symbol of Fire would force the individual to begin the puzzle anew."
"Linking the proper elements to the holy symbols was key for completion, but usually only a step. At each successful stage, the seeker was granted a gem. Enough gems were needed to unlock the final door, indicated with a skull."
"The elven civilization has dwindled in recent centuries, but their spirits still wait in the crypt. While they have no direct animosity towards humans, they often become agitated when non-elves enter their holy grounds. For this reason, The Necris Monks will serve to protect the spirits until the elves return."

"<^ finds a few pieces of parchment and reads aloud.> 3 Mai 342, Expeditionary Force, Royal Guard, Castle Garrison, Commander Munk. We have begun our mission to find the source of the beasts that have attacked our castle after yesterday's earthquake. Our force consists of myself, Sergeant Hamud, and six of his best men. Queen Juhanna has commanded us to find the beasts and eradicate them."
"4 Mai 342. We have been searching for over a day and have yet to find the beasts. The caverns appear to be larger than we imagined. It is amazing such an intricate maze of tunnels existed under our capital without our knowledge."
"4-5 Mai 342. I do not know what day it is; the atmosphere in here never changes. We have yet to find a beast and the men are becoming frantic. I almost dare not say, but I worry that we may not find our way back out in these caverns."
"6? Mai... How completely perplexing. Today we arrived at a door, but no amount of striking it would make it budge. It is most unusual to find a man made structure in this abyss. The men are talking of witchcraft and I am convinced now that we must leave this place. If we do not hurry out of here, I fear the worst."
"8? 9? I have completely lost track of the date. To make matters worse, we have made a wrong turn. The caverns here do not look familiar. We are running out of supplies. We did find one of the beasts and managed to slay him without casualties. He didn't confront us directly, and Hamud believes he may have been following us for some time."
"We have failed. The creatures have ambushed us! They are more intelligent and organized than we imagined. Dozens of them took us by surprise and slew four of our men.

A curse upon these beasts."
