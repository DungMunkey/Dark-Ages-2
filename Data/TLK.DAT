"Edowoin: The man is bloody crazy. He thinks he can conquer the world and he's willing to do it with the lives of his own serfs. He works us to death, and if we refuse, he puts us to death. He needs to be stopped and that necromancer was supposed to be our savior."
"$: Sorry, Edowoin, but Maenig made a deal and kept his part honorably. There's no ill between him and us."
"Edowoin: Then I'll make you a deal he could never top. The miners have been stashing small amounts of gold from veins in the mine. We've accumulated about 3000 pieces worth. You can have it if you kill Maenig and end our suffering. It will not be easy, he keeps the best trained troops I've ever seen. You'll have to kill all of them before trying to get Maenig."
"$: This is a dangerous task you are asking us to do, and you stand there in rags and tell us you're rich enough to pay for such a job."
"Edowoin: Here, take this. 500 gold. Consider it an up-front payment on our contract. You'll get the remaining 2500 if you can kill Maenig. If you fail, you're on your own and we've never met."

"Captain Scythe: During the Great Catastropy, trolls assaulted Yanthenar. The city tried to defend itself, but was split in half by violent tremors. The trolls overran the people and slaughtered nearly everyone."
"@: I thought Yanthenar was destroyed."
"Captain Scythe: Aye, that is true in a way. What Yanthenar stood for was destroyed. But the city still stands. I was there, and sailed the few survivors to the mainland. The king did not survive, and the trolls still inhabit the place. Some say there is treasure to be found on the island. I can sail you there if you're so bold."

"Jelle: Looking for some local gossip? I've got much better than that. Ilmari is home to a legend among sailors. His name is Captain Scythe, and he commanded the only ship to sail from Yanthenar and tell the tale of its demise. You see, the quake hit, and trolls ambushed the city, killing nearly everyone."
"Jelle: But Captain Scythe was no coward. He commanded his crew to rush the gates and pull out as many survivors as he could. Nearly all his men died rounding up citizens while fighting off the bloodthirsty trolls. When the capital was finally overrun, the trolls mounted a charge against the dock, nearly overtaking the few surviving crew and refugees trying to reach Scythe's ship."
"Jelle: But Scythe had giant crossbows mounted on his deck and he fired over the heads of his fellows and into the gang of trolls. They turned and fled, and the captain sailed the survivors to safety before they could regroup. Ever since, Scythe has made his home here. He's at the docks if you want to talk with him."

"<@ briefly explains what has happened so far, omitting several details, and not revealing what Matthias doesn't know. He doesn't mention the guild problems, but does include the interference by The Rein. Matthias's expression darkens when he hears this.>"
"Matthias: It seems we have something in common. The Rein came to me a few months ago demanding access to the pass. They provided compensation for their use, so I agreed. Then I noticed they started moving troops through the mountains, most likely headed towards Tristen. I tried to close off the pass and fighting broke out. Since then, I've managed to regain control of the pass, but at such a loss to my army that I cannot battle The Rein any longer."
"So here I sit, fenced in my own keep. The Rein seems more than content to let my men and me starve - they know I can't survive long. I've tried opening the pass to bring in supplies, but the Rein army simply ambushes whoever came through. It is a wonder you were able to get by. Then again, being just three of you, your passage probably went unnoticed."
"Perhaps it was fortunate you were able to convince my guards to let you through the pass. Perhaps we can help each other. If you can help me break the siege, I swear to help you in your endeavors. I can tell you've hidden much from me, but it doesn't matter. If I don't trust you now, I will surely fall to The Rein."
"But first, before we try to break the siege, I need medical supplies for my troops. Many have died already, and more will follow unless I can get their wounds properly treated. There is a healer in Nanten who can make a potion so powerful, only a drop is needed to cure infection and restore health. My forces are too weak to attempt this task, so I must ask you to do it."
"Be careful when leaving. You'll likely need to travel past The Rein camp. Take care not to make contact with any of them. They do not take kindly to anyone who attempts to enter or leave my keep and will attack. Good journey and a safe return!"

Thousands of years ago, when elves dominated the civilized world, pilgrims would descend into the crypt to seek the knowledge of their ancients."
"Sister Gespenst: But before the wisdom could be obtained, the pilgrims would have to pass a rite of passage. This involved a test, usually related to nature."
"@: What about the spirits? Aren't we angering them?"
"Sister Gespenst: Don't mind them much, if you can. They're probably a little agitated that you're there. You can't kill them, they're already dead. You can scare them off, but as you may notice, they keep coming back. If you want to learn more, I have written a book that can be found in the library."

They can become upset when humans wander in there, so that in tending the grounds, I can also protect curious persons from wandering into danger.

He brazenly went into the caverns with only seven men against creatures that had over 200 years to grow in numbers. He made it all the way to Quothar's abode, but could not enter and solve the mystery himself, and he lost his life for it."

"^: Oh great..."
"Imadalo: Did you know that the quake did not entirely destroy the castle? No sir! Sure, it has been weathered to almost nothing now, but back then it was going to be rebuilt. That is until something strange happened. The quake opened up a deep cavern and out spewed dozens of ervolts! Nobody had ever seen an ervolt until that day. Several escaped to the hills where they have plagued us since."
"Imadalo: Queen Juhanna thought the attack was the work of an evil mage she had banished from the castle. The wizard cursed her and swore he would get revenge. Then there was the quake and out came the ervolts. It might very well have been an assassination attempt."
"Imadalo: The Queen's advisor thinks differently. Two weeks before the quake he said he saw an omen in the sky that fortold the doom of the kingdom. The Queen didn't believe him, and you and I probably wouldn't either, but look what happened."
"Imadalo: But the Queen was determined to thwart any attempt at her or her kingdom. She sent her best commander, Munk, into the caverns to eradicate the ervolts. He left with only a week's supply of food. After three weeks, he still had not returned and ervolts started coming out of the caverns again. She had no choice but to seal up the hole and abandon the castle."
"Imadalo: Two years later, she seated herself in the new throne at Yanthenar. The castle grounds have since been abandoned and nobody dares go near it - not even me. I'm content to try my research from a safe distance. You can go see it if you dare. You'll know you're there when you see the broken remains surrounding the lush ironwood grove."

What great luck we thought, but we had no idea how dangerous some of the items in there were. There was a small box that we opened up, and out burst all sorts of demonic beasts. We tried to outrun them, but they were too fast. Homer, our wizard, cast a barrier to hold them back, but it doesn't seem to work on the demonic beasts."
"Camille: They killed us one by one as we ran out. I and a few others survived, but everyone else has abandoned this venture. That is why I need your help. If you can clear out the creatures, I will reward you with a powerful item from my stock."
"@: What do we need to do?"
"Camille: You must destroy the box that summoned the creatures. But first, you must find Homer's wand so that you can remove the barrier. It doesn't stop the creatures, but it will not let you pass. In his haste, Homer turned down the wrong tunnel and never came out. Bring it to me and I will show you how to use it. The last time I saw him, he turned west at the fork where we left the wheelbarrow."

They use the trees for target practice and many of them are burnt. The toxins in the soil from these potions fertilize some unusual herbs. While collecting them some time ago, I noticed a strange man pull on a tree branch, then disappear. When I went to the tree to get a closer look, there was no sign of him."

"For some time now, we've been raided by a group of bandits. You see, our people have for years processed, distilled, and created many components from the forest and mountains to the northeast. Those bandits have several rogue alchemists and they raid our village and steal our rare components. Their attacks are becoming more frequent and fierce and we are too small and powerless to stop them."

If you can kill the goblin chief the rest will become disorganized and it will stop the raids until we can build up our own defenses.

As you can see, there are signs of a struggle, but no body."

"@: What do we have to do?"
"Sebastian: My price isn't cheap, so I'll give you two options. The first is to pay me a flat rate of 2000 gold. If you cause trouble in Unschuld, they'll trace that note to me. I want to be compensated in advance for any discomfort I might suffer. My advisor handles all matters concerning money. He is the man in the gray robes. Talk to him if you wish to simply pay the fee."
"@: What's the second option?"
"Sebastian: There is a troublesome poacher on my lands to the northwest. He knows my guards too well and how to avoid them. You being Guild members would be better suited to make a surprise encounter. Talk to my captain, the man in the armor, if you would rather perform this task. I want this pest off my land for good - if you know what I mean. Make sure he is never able to return."

"@: That is a Fastral school. We should be able to find someone at the Hidden City, right?"

"Okyon: He is a dwarf named Wilthanur. He's not the friendliest of mages - considered by some to be rogue. He left the Floating City over 50 years ago to pursue his own studies. It's the nice way of saying his philosophy on magic was too reactionary for the tastes of the Abastral. He pursues magic of both schools, and I hear he's got quite the tower now. He keeps himself well guarded against intruders, so you might have some difficulty seeing him."

When he died, he willed it to me."

They are trapped by the magic of the shaid, Exul, and cannot escape back to Engel. We, however, are not affected because we are not elves. Still, perhaps we can help them. We must find the magic belt of their dead Gai'un, Varsiam. It was taken by undead creatures to a cave somewhere in the dead forest."

"$: I am $, and they are @ and ^. We used a strange elven relic to arrive here. It was curiosity that brought us. Who are you and where are we?"
"Feonim: You are humans! This is very strange. I am Feonim, queen of clan Eldarch of the Tsaido. You have arrived in the Dead Forest, a cursed land that exists within the magical energies of Engel. Think of it like the astral plane."
"Feonim: What you see around you is the last of my dying clan. We were banished here by a rival clan during the war for power after the fall of Ionim. We have been here for two centuries, and I'm afraid we will soon perish."
"@: Wait a minute... You can't be Tsaido, they vanished nearly 3000 years ago. Only a few elves remain and they are slowly diminishing."
"Feonim: What? Has it been so long? Our Gai'un feared time might not move the same on this plane. Then there is no home to return to and no point to continuing here. This forest shall be our grave."
"$: What do you mean?"
"Feonim: Many centuries ago, the Tsaido were attacked by Exul, an evil shaid. He was banished to this realm where he could not harm us anymore. But when the war for power broke out, we were banished as well."
"Feonim: Our Gai'un, Varsiam, was able to open a portal to return, but it did not work. Exul had corrupted this realm with his magic, and his hatred of elves prevents the portal from allowing us to enter."
"Feonim: Varsiam went to fight him, to purify the realm and allow us to return. But he was ambushed by undead creatures and killed. The undead took his magic belt back to their underground lair and we have been unable to recover it."
"Feonim: Without him or his belt, we were too weak to break through the magic guarding Exul's fortress. Exul then raised hundreds of undead wolves to attack us in the forest. We were forced to build a wall for defense and to live here to survive."
"Feonim: Exul's curse is devastating. Our water is tainted, and the ground is full of pestilence. Our crops are stunted and withered, and our people are frail. Each year we grew smaller in number, but hope remained. That is until you arrived. Now we know we are the last of the Tsaido, and we will die here."
"@: What will happen to us?"
